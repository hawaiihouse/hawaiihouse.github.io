							<h1> Avocado Plant</h1>
							<p>10/13/2021</p>
							<p>This was the first plant I have successfully grown. It can thrive on the water for a long time. Loves sun and warmth. I have only grown a small version of the Avocado plant because I have sprouted it in summer. As it is a cold season now in Lithuania - it has fallen asleep and will reach a growing phase in spring. </>

							<h1> Snake Plant</h1>
								<p>10/13/2021</p>
							<p>Yikes! Snake plant is quite a harsh name for such a good plant. Why is it good though? It produces much more oxygen than many other plants, which is why I keep it beside my bed. It is also very easy to take care of it - it thrives of neglect. You can forget to give it light or water for days and it will only look better.</>

							<h1> Mango Tree</h1>
								<p>10/13/2021</p>
							<p> Because I have planted it in autumn I'll haven't seen much progress. It did not die or anything, but its growth is very slow. Of course, it is a tropical plant, which is why I think that it will reach its full potential when it's sunny and warm again in Lithuania. </>

							<h1> The ZZ Plant</h1>
								<p>10/13/2021</p>
							<p>In Lithuania, it is believed that this plant brings money to the house. Its full name is Zanzibar gem. Super easy to take care of it - does not need light, nor much watering. Looks beautiful and is propagated quite easily in the summertime, you just need to put its leaf into a glass of water and it will shortly spread its roots.</>
