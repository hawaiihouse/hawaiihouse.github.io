							<h1> About Me</h1>
							<p> My name is Radvile. I am a young female based in Lithuania, living by the Baltic Sea.</p>
							<p> Some features that differentiate me from others are expressiveness, strong intuition, splashing creativity, and love for nature.
						</p>
						<p>
						I have a dream to live in Hawaii one day. An idea popped into my head - I shall create my own Hawaii jungle in my home while I wait. Each week I bring a new plant to my house or even grow them from the fruit or vegetables consumed. Just an idea has shifted to series of different experiments and try-outs with the plants. This has become more than a decor idea - a hobby, I would say, and only the future can tell how it will, later on, impact my knowledge and the look of my home.</>
</p>
<p> Here is the video that inspires me to create. </p>
